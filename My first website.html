  <li>When I'm stable long enough

I start to look around for love

See a sweet in floral print

My mind begins the arrangements

But when I start to feel that pull

Turns out I just pulled myself

She would never go with me

Were I the last girl on earth

I'm dumb, she's a lesbian

I thought I had found the one

We were good as married in my mind

But married in my mind's no good

Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve

Let me know the truth, let me know the truth

Might have smoked a few in my time

But never thought it was a crime

Knew the day would surely come

When I'd chill and settle down

When I think I've found a good old-fashioned girl

Then she put me in my place

Everyone's a little queer

Oh, can't she be a little straight?

I'm dumb, she's a lesbian

I thought I had found the one

We were good as married in my mind

But married in my mind's no good

Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve

Let me know the truth, let me know the truth

I'm dumb, she's a lesbian

I thought I had found the one

Oh, we were good as married in my mind

But married in my mind's no good

Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve

Let me know the truth, let me know the truth

I'm dumb, she's a lesbian

I thought I had found the one

Oh, we were good as married in my mind

But married in my mind's no good

Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve

Let me know the truth

Let me know the truth

Let me know the truth

Let me know the truth</li>

 	 <li>What's with these homies, dissing my girl?

Why do they gotta front?

What did we ever do to these guys

That made them so violent?

Woo-hoo

But you know I'm yours

Woo-hoo

And I know you're mine

Woo-hoo

(And that's for all time)

Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly

Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore

I don't care what they say about us anyway

I don't care about that

Don't you ever fear, I'm always near

I know that you need help

Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit

You need a guardian

Woo-hoo

And you know I'm yours

Woo-hoo

And I know you're mine

Woo-hoo

(And that's for all time)

Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly

Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore

I don't care what they say about us anyway

I don't care about that

I don't care about that

Bang, bang, a knock on the door

Another big bang and you're down on the floor

Oh no! What do we do?

Don't look now, but I lost my shoe

I can't run, and I can't kick

What's the matter babe, are you feeling sick?

What's the matter, what's the matter, what's the matter you?

What's the matter babe, are you feeling blue?

Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly

Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore

I don't care what they say about us anyway

I don't care about that

I don't care about that

I don't care about that

I don't care about that</li>

   <ol>

    <li>I'm so tall, can't get over me

I'm so low, can't get under me

I must be all these things

For I just threw out the love of my dreams

He is in my eyes, he is in my ears

He is in my blood, he is in my tears

I breathe love, and see him everyday

Even though my love's a world away

Oh, he's got me wondering

My righteousness is crumbling

Never before have I felt this way

Know what is right, want for him to stay

I must be made of steel

For I just threw out the love of my dreams

He is in my eyes, he is in my ears

He is in my blood, he is in my tears

I breathe love, and see him everyday

Even though my love's a world away

Oh, he's got me wondering

My righteousness is crumbling

Oh, he's got me wondering

My righteousness is crumbling

And I see him everyday

Even though my love's a world away

He is in my eyes, he is in my ears

He is in my blood, he is in my tears

I must be made of steel

For I just threw out the love of my dreams
